# Ethereum_AI_dapp

Here is an example of how to create a simple Ethereum decentralized application (dapp) for AI art using the Solidity programming language

This contract defines a AIMarketplace contract that extends the ERC-721 non-fungible token standard to create a marketplace for AI art. It includes a mapping to store the art pieces, a struct to represent an art piece, a constructor to initialize the contract, and functions to create and transfer art pieces.

Note that this is just a simple example, and there are many different ways to implement an Ethereum dapp for AI art. The specific requirements and features of the dapp will depend on the specific goals and requirements of the project.
